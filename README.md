# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

**Description**

This is my sprint 3 project in the the TripleTen software engineering course. This project enforced my skills in reponsive web design, so my webpages can look
great on a desktop, phone, or tablet. This project also emphasized the use of grid layouts, which when used alongside flexbox, can improve the layout and design
of the webpages elements. This webpage features the header, a profile section, and the cards with images and like buttons. I hope you like this webpage.
